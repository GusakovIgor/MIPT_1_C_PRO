# Pr.3-Soft_CPU

My own assembler language and the program that compiles it.

Text on my language is converted to a binary file. Then another program is reading a binary file and executing commands.

Both programs and main header are using preprocessor code generation, so itâ€™s very easy to expand the list of commands, and code is readable.
