# Pr.6 Differentiate
 
Itâ€™s a program that differentiates expressions with variables and some functions. It generates a LaTeX file as a result.

Expression is parsed into a tree with a recursive descent method. For differentiating I wrote DSL, so the code is very easy to understand. There is also a simplification of tree and autogeneration of an output LaTeX file.
